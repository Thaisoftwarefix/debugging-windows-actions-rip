# A lot of you suck.

Ugh, the internet ruined https://github.com/nelsonjchen/reverse-rdp-windows-github-actions .

There are many derivatives of it out there, but please don't abuse with them either. This is a tombstone to that project and guide. 

To those of you who genuinely used that project to debug Windows GitHub actions builds like with this:

https://github.com/chevah/pythia/blob/e9393583fe848265df2db9e19c226036a40ec5e9/.github/workflows/main.yaml#L71

Thanks. I hope it was very useful to debug Windows builds, a not-as-friendly-as-Unix CLI platform.

The rest of you, screw you.
